# GTA V Mod Language Manager

The GTA V Mod Language Manager is a C# utility designed for seamless integration with Grand Theft Auto V modifications. This tool simplifies the localization of your mod by managing and formatting language strings from an XML file.

## Features

- **Efficient String Management:** The `LanguageManager` class efficiently handles language strings, making it easy to organize and retrieve them.

- **XML File Support:** Store your language strings in an XML file for easy editing and maintenance.

- **Dynamic String Formatting:** Utilize the `GetLocalizedString` method to dynamically format language strings based on provided keys and parameters.

## Usage

1. **Initialization:**
   ```csharp
   LanguageManager languageManager = new LanguageManager("path/to/languagefile.xml");
2. **Retrieve Localized Strings:**
   ```csharp
   string formattedString = languageManager.GetLocalizedString("StringKey", param1, param2);
3. **Error Handling:**
   In case a key is not found, the method gracefully provides an error message.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-mod.git
2. Include the `LanguageManager.cs` file in your GTA V mod project.

3. Customize the `languagefile.xml` with your localized strings.

4. Integrate the `LanguageManager` into your mod to streamline language localization.

## Example
```csharp
// Initialize LanguageManager
LanguageManager languageManager = new LanguageManager("path/to/languagefile.xml");

// Retrieve and display a formatted string
string formattedString = languageManager.GetLocalizedString("WelcomeMessage", playerName);
UI.Screen.ShowSubtitle(formattedString, 5000);
```
